Some attempt at a predicted shortest job first (PSJF) scheduler for the Linux
kernel.

It runs a lot slower than the normal scheduler.

Install notes:
Copy files onto a clean extraction of linux-3.10.10 sources and allow to
overwrite. Compile the kernel with SMP disabled and with SCHED_RR/FIFO
disabled. Only tested for a 32-bit kernel. Compilation for 64-bit kernel may
or may not work, or may cause errors upon boot.
